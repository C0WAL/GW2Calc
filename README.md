  GW2 Calculator
</h1>

## üóíÔ∏è Summary

GW2 Calculator is a website I wrote as a project to learn some react. The goal is to provide a simple interface for some common calculations made by Guild Wars 2 players.
Quick overview of functionalities is listed below

1.  **Skirmish reward track**

    Basic configuration to calculate required time to finish the weekly skirmish reward track.
    All information about additional pip modifiers was taken directly from the game wiki.

2.  **WvW Reward track (WIP)**

    Allows for precise calculation of reward track points per tick including instant reward track progress from Skirmish chests.
